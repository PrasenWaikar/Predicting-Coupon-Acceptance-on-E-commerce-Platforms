# Predicting-Coupon-Acceptance-on-E-commerce-Platforms

📌𝑷𝒓𝒐𝒋𝒆𝒄𝒕 𝑶𝒗𝒆𝒓𝒗𝒊𝒆𝒘 

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict whether a customer will accept a discount coupon on an e-commerce platform. By analyzing customer behavior, purchase history, and demographic details, the model helps businesses optimize their marketing strategies and improve customer engagement.



❓𝑷𝒓𝒐𝒃𝒍𝒆𝒎 𝑺𝒕𝒂𝒕𝒆𝒎𝒆𝒏𝒕:

E-commerce platforms offer discount coupons to attract customers, but not all customers utilize them. Identifying which customers are likely to accept coupons can help businesses optimize their promotional campaigns, reduce marketing costs, and improve customer retention. The goal is to develop a predictive model that can classify whether a user will accept a given coupon based on historical and behavioral data.



✨ 𝑲𝒆𝒚 𝑯𝒊𝒈𝒉𝒍𝒊𝒈𝒉𝒕𝒔:

▪️Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand trends, patterns, and correlations in customer behavior.

▪️Feature engineering to improve the model’s predictive capability.

▪️Implemented classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.

▪️Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to ensure high performance.

▪️Data visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn to gain insights into customer behavior and coupon acceptance rates.

Optimized the model using hyperparameter tuning for improved accuracy.
